      <h2>Why do I need this?</h2>
      <p>
        From March 2019, all data on Dnote will be encrypted to respect your
        privacy. To benefit from this new system, you are required to login here
        and set your credentials.
      </p>

      <h2>How long does it take?</h2>
      <p>It will take a minute.</p>

      <h2>What do I need to do?</h2>
      <p>
        After logging in, you will choose an email/password combination. If you
        already have one, you can reuse it. Then, the page will automatically
        encrypt all your data from the beginning of time.
      </p>

      <h2>How will the encryption work?</h2>
      <p>
        Dnote will use AES256 block cipher to encrypt everything before sending
        it to the server. AES256 is considered unbreakable and is used by
        government agencies around the world to encrypt top secrets.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I change email/password later?</h2>
      <p>Yes, you can.</p>
